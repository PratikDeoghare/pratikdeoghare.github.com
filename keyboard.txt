Could touch-typing be bad for you?

#p{
	Why people who don't touch-type,
	type with just two fingers,
	don't seem to get
	any ergonomics related problems?
	
	Perhaps touch-typing is the root of the problems.

	Do not touchtype.
	Save money on the fancy keyboard.
	You will be typing less.
	Staring at the screen less.
	And perhaps thinking a little more.
