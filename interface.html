  <title>Embedding Golang Interfaces into Structs to Simplify

  <h2>Embedding Golang Interfaces into Structs to Simplify
  Testing</h2>
  <p>You can embed an interface inside a struct in golang. I
  discovered it by accident not by reading the manual.</p>
  <p>Here is a problem that it solves. Here are many more [1].</p>
  <p>You have a dependency on an external library. The library
  exports a large interface. You want to mock it for testing but
  then you will have to implement all the methods on it. That can
  be a lot of work. What if you could implement just the methods
  you need?</p>
  <p>You can do that by embedding interfaces like this. You embed
  <code>LargeExternalClient</code> interface into
  <code>mockClient</code>, then implement only <code>MethodF</code>
  from the interface because that is the only one
  <code>YourClient</code> uses. If somewhere in the code some other
  method on the interface is in use without your knowledge and you
  don't implement it on <code>mockClient</code>, you will get a
  panic. A good thing. Then you just add that one. Test won't
  silently pass.</p>
  <pre>
package main

import (
        "testing"
)

// somewhere in the imported library.go

type LargeExternalClient interface {
        MethodA()
        MethodB()
        MethodC()
        MethodD()
        MethodE()
        MethodF() int
        MethodG()
        MethodH()
        MethodI()
}

// code.go
type YourClient struct {
        cli LargeExternalClient
}

func (y YourClient) Foo() int {
        return y.cli.MethodF()
}

// code_test.go

type mockClient struct {
        LargeExternalClient
}

func (mockClient) MethodF() int {
        return 23
}

func TestYourClient(t *testing.T) {
        y := YourClient{
                cli: new(mockClient),
        }

        if y.Foo() != 23 {
                t.Fail()
        }
}
