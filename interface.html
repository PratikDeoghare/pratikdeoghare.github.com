<h2>Embedding Golang Interfaces into Structs to Simplify Testing</h2>

<p>
	You can embed an interface inside a struct in golang. I discovered it
	by accident not by reading the manual.

</p>

<p>
	Here is a problem that it solves. Here are many more [1]. 
</p>

<p>
	You have a dependency on an external library. The library 
	exports a large interface. You want to mock it for testing
	but then you will have to implement all the methods on it. 
	That can be a lot of work. What if you could implement just the 
	methods you need? 
</p>

<p>
	You can do that by embedding interfaces like this. You embed <code> LargeExternalClient</code> 
interface into <code> mockClient</code>, then implement only <code> MethodF</code> from the interface because 
that is the only one <code> YourClient</code> uses. If somewhere in the code some other method 
on the interface is in use without your knowledge and you don't implement it on 
<code> mockClient</code>, you will get a panic. A good thing. Then you just add that one. Test
won't silently pass. 
</p>

<pre>
package main

import (
	"testing"
)

// somewhere in the imported library.go

type LargeExternalClient interface {
	MethodA()
	MethodB()
	MethodC()
	MethodD()
	MethodE()
	MethodF() int
	MethodG()
	MethodH()
	MethodI()
}

// code.go
type YourClient struct {
	cli LargeExternalClient
}

func (y YourClient) Foo() int {
	return y.cli.MethodF()
}

// code_test.go

type mockClient struct {
	LargeExternalClient
}

func (mockClient) MethodF() int {
	return 23
}

func TestYourClient(t *testing.T) {
	y := YourClient{
		cli: new(mockClient),
	}

	if y.Foo() != 23 {
		t.Fail()
	}
}

</pre>
