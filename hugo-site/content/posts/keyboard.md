Why people who don't touch-type,
type with just two fingers,
don't seem to get
any ergonomics related problems?

Perhaps touch-typing is the root of the problems.

Do not touchtype.
Save money on the fancy keyboard.
You will be typing less.
Staring at the screen less.
And perhaps thinking a little more.

I type this on my 4th mechanical keyboard.
