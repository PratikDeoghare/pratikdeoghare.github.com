    <h2>Using Complex Numbers to Move Mars Rover</h2>

    <p>Recently I was given <a href="https://code.google.com/archive/p/marsrovertechchallenge/">Mars Rover Problem</a>
        and told that my solution was pretty cool. Before that I assumed this is how everybody else was
        doing it :-). Here is <a href="https://github.com/pratikdeoghare/mars-rover-problem">golang implementation</a>.
        Enjoy!</p>

    <h3>Design</h3>

    <p>Position and orientation are represented as complex numbers implemented as <code>type vect</code>.
        Builtin complex type is not used because it uses floats which they can't be compared easily. </p>

    <p>In calculations below <code>j</code> is <code>sqrt(-1)</code>. </p>

    <p><strong>Multiplication of complex numbers allow us to rotate.</strong></p>

    <p><code>L</code>: To rotate by 90 left we multiply by <code>j</code>.</p>

    <p><code>R</code>: To rotate by 90 right we multiply by <code>-j</code>. </p>

    <p>Mapping of directions to complex numbers.
        <pre>
            North: j
            East: 1
            West: -1
            South: j
        </pre></p>

    <p>Example: A rover is looking north and we issue <code>R</code> command. </p>

    <p><pre>
        North * R
        = j * -j
        = 1
        = East // position unchanged
    </pre></p>

    <p><strong>Addition of complex numbers allow for movements on the grid.</strong></p>

    <p>Example: A rover is at <code>(1,2)</code> looking to east and we issue <code>M</code> command we expect it to be
        at <code>(2,2)</code>.</p>

    <p><pre>
        rover position (1,1) + E
        = (1 + 2j) + 1
        = 2 + 2j
        = (2, 2) // orientation unchanged
    </pre></p>
