  <h2>Using Complex Numbers to Move Mars Rover</h2>
  <p>Recently I was given <a href=
  "https://code.google.com/archive/p/marsrovertechchallenge/">Mars
  Rover Problem</a> and told that my solution was pretty cool.
  Before that I assumed this is how everybody else was doing it
  :-). Here is <a href=
  "https://github.com/pratikdeoghare/mars-rover-problem">golang
  implementation</a>. Enjoy!</p>
  <h3>Design</h3>
  <p>Position and orientation are represented as complex numbers
  implemented as <code>type vect</code>. Builtin complex type is
  not used because it uses floats which they can't be compared
  easily.</p>
  <p>In calculations below <code>j</code> is
  <code>sqrt(-1)</code>.</p>
  <p><strong>Multiplication of complex numbers allow us to
  rotate.</strong></p>
  <p><code>L</code>: To rotate by 90 left we multiply by
  <code>j</code>.</p>
  <p><code>R</code>: To rotate by 90 right we multiply by
  <code>-j</code>.</p>
  <p>Mapping of directions to complex numbers.</p>
  <pre>
            North: j
            East: 1
            West: -1
            South: j
        </pre>
  <p>Example: A rover is looking north and we issue <code>R</code>
  command.</p>
  <pre>
        North * R
        = j * -j
        = 1
        = East // position unchanged
    </pre>
  <p><strong>Addition of complex numbers allow for movements on the
  grid.</strong></p>
  <p>Example: A rover is at <code>(1,2)</code> looking to east and
  we issue <code>M</code> command we expect it to be at
  <code>(2,2)</code>.</p>
  <pre>
        rover position (1,1) + E
        = (1 + 2j) + 1
        = 2 + 2j
        = (2, 2) // orientation unchanged
    </pre>
